# TJI
Toggl Jira Integration is made to simplify time tracking in Jira. Toggl enables users to log time in a convinient way but teams using Jira will most likely want to be able to follow progress and time spent in that system. So this program was written to remove the need for duplicated logging. It uses the description of you Toggl entry to find the correct issue and add or syncronize the corresponding item in its worklog.

The program is still in a very early stage and not very stable in its current form.
